ðŸ”‹ A batteries-included **Python** extension for [Nova](https://nova.app)!


## What's in the box?

* Integration with Microsoft's [Pyright language server](https://microsoft.github.io/pyright/#/)
* Code formatting using [Ruff](https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/) or [Black](https://black.readthedocs.io/en/stable/)
* Linting (and import organization) with [Ruff](https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/)
* A Virtual Environment task for running a script or Python module as though the project's virtual environment is active
* A Cleanup task for clearing out Python cache files, build artifacts, and other files/directories
* A tree-sitter based syntax for `requirements.txt` files, based off of [tree-sitter-requirements](https://github.com/tree-sitter-grammars/tree-sitter-requirements)
* A sidebar showing all packages installed in your configured Python environment, along with any outdated versions, and optionally any known vulnerabilities using [pip-audit](https://github.com/pypa/pip-audit)

## Requirements

If you use [Homebrew](https://brew.sh), the easiest way to get started is:

`brew install pyright ruff pip-audit`

This extension will try to find tools installed on your `PATH`, so installing into your virtual environment or another location should work, as well.
